# kinect_bend
Using Kinect V2 to detect a person's "bending-down" action.

## Dependencies
Kinect v2 SDK (headers and lib)
Direct 2D 

The provided example code for coordinate mapping that comes with the Kinect V2 SDK is a great starting point.

TODO: 
  1. Detect bending by tracking neck and hip joints
  2. Redo implementation to remove unneeded features
